All products are designed to work with Home Assistant.
PCB design and enclosures are custom made to be as smallest as possible but also look nice.

Most of them will use ESP32 cips because of how small and reliable they are.
ESP32 allready contain a WiFi cip and it make it very easy to use it into Home Assistant.
Another reason that ESP32 cips are so good is that ESPHome (that uses yaml code) contain all important libraries used to control different sensors.
